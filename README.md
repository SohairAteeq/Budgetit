BudgetIt is a personal finance management application that helps users track income and expenses, organize transactions into categories, and set monthly budget goals. The app provides a simple and intuitive way to record financial activity, giving users a clear picture of where their money is going. By storing data securely in a database and offering a clean interface, it makes everyday financial tracking straightforward and reliable.

In addition to basic tracking, BudgetIt includes features for generating reports and visualizing spending patterns through charts and graphs. These insights allow users to analyze their habits, identify areas of overspending, and adjust their budgets accordingly. The project demonstrates practical use of modern technologies such as Spring Boot for backend services, a relational database for data storage, and optional frontend frameworks for user interaction, making it both functional and a strong learning project.
